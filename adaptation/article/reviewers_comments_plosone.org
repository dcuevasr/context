Reviewer #1: Summary:
This work proposes a simplified version of the recently introduced "context inference" (COIN) model (Heald et al. 2021) for modeling context dependent motor adaptation. In contrast to the original COIN models, the simplified model (termed “sCOIN”) retained the mechanisms for context inference, motor adaptation, and action selection while eliminating the components that support learning of new contexts and estimating the dynamics of environment transition between contexts. The authors demonstrate that sCOIN is capable of displaying three contextual motor learning phenomena, unexplored by Heald et al. (2021) but previously investigated in experimental studies on motor adaptation. These phenomena are linked to the effect of contextual information (cues and feedback) on context inference which in turn affects switching behavior. The model was utilized to simulate the learner adaptation behavior rather than utilizing it to fit subject data. The study shows that in simulations of the original setups, the "simplified COIN" (sCOIN) model exhibits motor adaptation sequences qualitatively similar to real subjects shown in the original papers.

Strengths:
1. Although I don't have much experience with motor learning modeling, the suggested simplification of the COIN model appears intriguing and the paper demonstrates its potential to explain interesting phenomena.
2. The model's behavior in simulations is very similar to experimental data.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper is well written but some parts are difficult to understand. The reader must refer to the original studies to understand the experimental paradigms. I would recommend adding illustrative figures of the paradigms and emphasizing the nature of cues and feedback.
2. The link between the paradigm aspects (both environment and learner) and the model variables is not always clear. In addition, how exactly the specific components of the model give rise to the observed phenomenon is not always explained (see detailed comments below).
3. The similarity between the simulated and real data is compared only qualitatively. I wonder whether these similarities could also be captured quantitatively.
4. It is not clear to me (Despite the reasons given in the paragraph starting in line 523) why the authors did not try to fit the sCoin model parameters to real subjects data instead of arbitrarily/empirically selecting them for the simulation.

* Reviewer 2
The effects of probabilistic context inference on motor adaptation
Reviewer summary: Recently, computational models and Bayesian for motor adaptation have
been introduced to demonstrate the effects of context inference on learning rates in various
experiments. Cuevas Rivera, Darío and Kiebel built a simplified version of the recently
introduced COIN model to demonstrate that the effects of context inference on motor adaptation
and control extend even further than previously demonstrated. They used this model to simulate
previous motor adaptation experiments and demonstrated that context inference, and how it is
affected by the presence and reliability of feedback, affect a variety of behavioral phenomena
which had previously required multiple hypothesized mechanisms. The authors suggest that the
reliability of direct contextual information, as well as noisy sensory feedback, which is common
in many experiments, cause measurable changes in switching-task behavior and action
selection that are directly related to probabilistic context inference.
I think the manuscript in its current state is a good starting point. The overall clarity of the writing
needs improvement. However, I feel as though the authors lack a clear understanding of the
behavioural phenomena they are attempting to model. Savings is not the absence of learning
upon re-exposure to the same previously experienced perturbation, but faster relearning. Error
clamps are not a zero force manipulation as in baseline trials. There is a matching of the force
generated by participants and visually displayed to participants as zero error. Any previously
learned perturbations will decay at this block of trials, rather than a learning of zero error.

** Minor issues
1. Lines 33-35 could add reference: Howard, I. S., Wolpert, D. M., & Franklin, D. W. (2013). The
effect of contextual cues on the encoding of motor memories. Journal of neurophysiology,
109(10), 2632-2644. (below)
2. Lines 40-41 add “upon re-exposure to the same perturbation”. The ability to recall previously learned skills upon re-exposure to the same perturbation,
called savings; (done)
1. Line 47 - models don’t do the adapting. “Whereby after each iteration, the change in motor
commands is related to the measure of error.” (done)
4. Line 47 The most well-studied models are ...” (done)
5. Lines 49-50 from “but Bayesian accounts have also been presented, providing an alternative
explanation for savings and quick de-adaptation in the form of switching between forward
models” to “while Bayesian models have been shown to provide an alternative explanation
for savings and quick de-adaptation in the form of switching between forward models.” (done)
6. Lines 61-63, “Heald et al. (2021) formalized context inference as a process that
operates independently from motor learning, but is informed by it, establishing a loop whereby context inference also informs motor learning.” but is informed by it - this is unclear (done)
7. Line 66 - in this work we show (done)
8. Line 70 - remove “so-called” (done)
9. Line 104 - add “s” to component (done)
10. Figure 1. How are motor commands “observable”? (below)
11. Lines 137-138. The robot motors exert a force on the handle of the robot, held by the
participant. It does not exert force on the participant’s hand. (done)
12. Lines 154-157. More clearly stated as the output of the simulated data qualitatively matches the
behavioural data observed in ..... <list of studies> (done)
13. Line 160 add “s” to provide (below)
14. Line 176-177 “in which the mechanical arm forces the participant to make straight-line movements” This is incorrect. The robot is programmed with spring and damping coefficients to match the force exerted by the participant and make it appear as though they are making a perfect trajectory from start position to target (i.e., the elimination of the visual error). (below)
15. Lines 182-183 “With repeated contexts (e.g. Oh & Schweighofer, 2019), an experiment can be described as O1. A1.O2”. This is unclear. (below)
16. Line 186 “without having to re-learn it.” They are learning in the second session of A, it is just that they are learning at a faster rate. (below)
17. Line 192. In the baseline condition there is nothing to learn (i.e., there is not perturbation). In this case there is a washout or decay of the learning of A. (below)
18. Line 195 and 199 replace “are” with “is” (below)
19. Did the simulated data represent the same number of subjects reported in the compared studies? This is unclear in the reading. (below)
20. Can the authors explain why their model predicts no savings upon the 4th presentation of the perturbation when the behavioural data to the right clearly shows savings. (From figure 2C). The learning rate of the model clearly lags behind the data. (below)
21. Line 249 replace “do” with “does” (below, same as 18)
22. Line 348, had begun or began (done)
23. Lines 407 - 413 There is no mention of the decay happening in error clamps. “Instead, participants slowly reduce their adaptation, often displaying spontaneous recovery” FIrst you get rebound and then you get decay ... this statement is misleading. (below)
24 413-417 Participants are often unaware of the presence of error clamps. How can the authors account for this finding in relation to the literature? I.e., Scheidt, R. A., Reinkensmeyer, D. J., Conditt, M. A., Rymer, W. Z., & Mussa-Ivaldi, F. A. (2000). Persistence of motor adaptation during constrained, multi-joint, arm movements. Journal of neurophysiology, 84(2), 853-862.. (below)
25. Experiments often interleave error clamp trials within the adaptation blocks. Can your sCOIN model account for the changes in behaviour during these trials, given that participants are often unaware they even occur?

** Major issues
26. Why are the simulations shown with SD and compared to participant data often using SEM?(below)
27. Introduction lacks a clear telling of the COIN model in its original form and an explanation for why it cannot account for various phenomena (i.e., which phenomena are not accounted for by the COIN model). This would open the discussion better to why changes made to the model would account for them.(below)
28. The interpretation of error clamps suggests a lack of understanding of what they are and how they are used in the motor adaptation, force field literature. See comments related to lines 413-417.(below)
29. Overall there lacks a clear and direct comparison (statistically between simulated outcomes and behavioural data). The comparisons are of a more qualitative nature. The authors could provide a regression metric.(below)
30. It would also be interesting to see not only the simulated data from the sCOIN model but also the COIN model to demonstrate where the COIN model fails to predict the data while the sCOIN improves the prediction. (below)
31. Rather than separate presentations of simulated model output and experimental data, these two learning curves could be overlaid in contrasting colors to highlight their similarities or differences. (below)

We appreciate the reviewer's attention to detail throughout the manuscript. All typos and other small mistakes pointed out by the reviewer have been corrected. Below, we list the more substantial changes or corrections we made to the manuscript in response to the reviewer's comments.

In our responses below, all line numbers refer to the new manuscript; however, the reviewers' comments refer to the lines in the previous submission.

** Line 136: provide more information on the "generic experiment". It would be easier to understand how contextual cues and sensory feedback are provided and noised. (Instead of just referring the reader to Davidson and Wolpert (2004))
We added a brief description of the experiment in this section, which can be seen in lines XXX. More details on the Davidson and Wolpert (2004) experiment were also added in their corresponding section.


** Reviewer 2
We appreciate the reviewer's attention to detail throughout the manuscript. All typos and other small mistakes pointed out by the reviewer have been corrected. Below, we list the more substantial changes or corrections we made to the manuscript in response to the reviewer's comments.

In our responses below, all line numbers refer to the new manuscript; however, the reviewers' comments refer to the lines in the previous submission.

*** Lines 61-63, “Heald et al. (2021) formalized context inference as a process that operates independently from motor learning, but is informed by it, establishing a loop whereby context inference also informs motor learning.” but is informed by it - this is unclear
We have rephrased this sentence to clarify the meaning.

*** 10. Figure 1. How are motor commands “observable”?
In this case, 'observable' refers to something to which the model and the brain have access to during movement and adaptation. It is not meant observable to experimenters. We have added clarification to the caption of Figure 1.

*** Line 160 add “s” to provide
We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, we believe that the plural matches the usage of dynamics in this context, as we refer not to the field of study but to the 'forces' causing the phenomena.

*** Line 176-177 “in which the mechanical arm forces the participant to make straight-line movements” This is incorrect. The robot is programmed with spring and damping coefficients to match the force exerted by the participant and make it appear as though they are making a perfect trajectory from start position to target (i.e., the elimination of the visual error).
We have addressed this comment by rephrasing the line.

*** Lines 182-183 “With repeated contexts (e.g. Oh & Schweighofer, 2019), an experiment can be described as O1. A1.O2”. This is unclear.
We rephrased this sentence and added more clarification.

*** Line 186 “without having to re-learn it.” They are learning in the second session of A, it is just that they are learning at a faster rate.
While it is almost universally observed that non-human primates show only accelerated learning on re-exposure to a known adaptation, many experiments with humans, especially those involving visuomotor rotations, have shown immediate recall of the previously learned adaptations. This can be seen, for example, in the experiments by Kim (2015), where learning "picks up where it left off" when a previous adaptation is encountered, and in the experiments by Oh and Schweighofer (2019). In cases where learning was already completed (i.e. motor error is close to zero under the new dynamics), the phenomenon is often called "switching", as we do throughout our manuscript.

We have added this discussion to the manuscript.

*** Line 192. In the baseline condition there is nothing to learn (i.e., there is not perturbation). In this case there is a washout or decay of the learning of A.
We agree with the reviewer. However, because the baseline context holds no special place in the model (outside of having been learned for long enough that learning occurs very slowly, or not at all during an experiment), we wanted to emphasize that there was no need to re-learn anything in these transitions.

*** Line 195 and 199 replace “are” with “is”
The word 'savings' is, as per the dictionary, plural (even when referring to the savings from a single purchase, for example). Usages in published work on motor adaptation with grammar that allows for a distinction between plural and singular are mixed; for example, Oh and Schweighofer (2019) chose plural ("Savings were dominant in the large perturbation conditions..."), while Herzfeld et al. (2014) chose singular ("Savings refers to the..."). Given the ambiguity in usage, we prefer to follow the accepted dictionary entries (consistent across the dictionaries by Merriam-Webster, Oxford and Collins).
